# Binary Search Tree in Java

## Overview

This repository contains a Java project showcasing the implementation and testing of Binary Search Trees (BST) and Adelson-Velsky and Landis (AVL) Trees. The project includes two primary classes: `BSTree` for the Binary Search Tree implementation and `AVLTree` for the AVL Tree implementation. Additionally, the `App` class contains the main method to execute tests on both tree implementations.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- `tree` package: Contains the `BSTree` and `AVLTree` classes.
- `App` class: Contains the `main` method to execute tests.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the project:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.
3. Navigate to the `App` class.
4. Run the `main` method in the `App` class.
5. View the console output to observe test results.

## Test Cases

The `App` class includes two methods:

- `BSTTest()`: Tests Binary Search Tree operations.
- `AVLTTest()`: Tests AVL Tree operations.

These methods demonstrate operations such as insertion, search, and traversal on both types of trees.
